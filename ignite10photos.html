David Ross of the <a href="http://www.5thl.com/">5th L</a> will be performing a poem about marriage at Ignite #10 on 3/15. We're helping him assemble the slides to accompany the poem, and we'd like to feature wedding pictures
from the audience. If you'd like to be included please send your photo to mike@ignitebaltimore.com. Thanks!
